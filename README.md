# ** INCOMPLETE  ONGOING- PROJECT** 
# kubernettes-recommendation-system 
This is an on-going project for deploying "Multimedia Recommendation System" using Python, Docker, and Kubernetes:

# Microservice architecture:

The idea is to have:

- User Service: Manages user registration, authentication, and profile management (including setting preferences).
- Recommendation Service: Based on user preferences, it recommends books, movies, documentaries, podcasts, etc.
- Content Service: Manages information about the various types of content (books, movies, documentaries, podcasts).

# Implementation of microservices:

- We will use Flask to implement these services. Each service will need its own database to manage its data.

# Dockerization of microservices:

- For each service, we create a Dockerfile and build Docker images for each of the services.

# Kubernetes Setup:

- Set up a Kubernetes cluster and configure kubectl.

# Deploy services to Kubernetes:

- Create Kubernetes Deployments and Services for each of the microservices and deploy these to Kubernetes cluster.

# Implement Resilience and Scalability:

- Use Kubernetes features to make services resilient and scalable. This includes liveness and readiness probes, as well as Horizontal Pod Autoscaling.

# CI/CD Pipeline:

- Set up a CI/CD pipeline that automatically tests, builds, and deploys services whenever you push new code.

# Monitoring and Logging:

- Set up monitoring and logging for the services.

# Implement the recommendation engine:

- This will likely be the most complex part of the project. We'll need to design and implement an algorithm (or multiple algorithms) that can provide relevant recommendations based on user preferences. 
- This might involve techniques from information retrieval, natural language processing, and machine learning.

# User Interface:

- Finally, we'll create a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the service. This could be a web frontend built with a framework like React or Vue.js, or even a simple command-line interface.
